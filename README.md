# JetBrains Analytics Project

This project was developed as part of the **JetBrains Internship Application (2025)**.  
It presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of model usage, request frequency, and pricing behavior using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 Overview
The notebook analyzes a dataset of JetBrains models to identify usage patterns, request efficiency, and cost-performance relationships.  
It includes data cleaning, visualization, and summary statistics to derive meaningful insights.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **Models C and D** show the highest total and average request counts — indicating best performance.  
- **Models A and B** are the most expensive but least used.  
- **Model E** is an outlier — it appears less often but generates strong total requests.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
